In 2020, Wechat launched the video channel, aiming to compete with Tiktok. I think it was an opportunity to learn how to run a video channel. In China, people like new things. Aka, there would be plenty of traffic generation from new things. We called it "风口"(Feng kou). It's actually from a book. If you know smartphone very well, you would probably heard Xiaomi. The book mentioned the phenomena the innovation of Xiaomi is based on marketing first. Because people's attentions and expectation are optimal when they are engaging with the whole production plan. It worked. 

My brand is designed for people who're interested in business. It's called 'Simple Business Mindset'. Usually, I would edit a short video within 1 min about celebrities such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg etc. When you're in business, you would have lots of thoughts to express and remind the young generations. So I decided to build my brands around these famous people. I think KPI of the video channel is 300 views averagely, 50 likes averagely, 36 reposts roughly. I think it's okay because I only spent 1 hour into getting materials, editing, thumbnails, subtitle, publish, promoting.
