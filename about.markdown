### About Shenghong Zhong

I see myself as an innovator with multiple cultural backgrounds and the curious mind required to transform systems with disruptive technology. My journey has included acquiring a range of technical skills generated by a year in a highly agile environment supporting skilled health strategy insights analytics team; and internships in an investment banking consultancy and a multinational life insurance company all whilst studying for a university degree.

This variety in current and previous roles has led to a wealth of knowledge in data management and global media market research, as well as strong, adaptable data analytic and people skills that can be utilised with flexibility and energy in a new Data Scientist role.
